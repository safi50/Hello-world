        <p>
                Everyone interviewed in the Times Square segment agreed that people in
                the United States should be able to share anything—even a photo
                privately over the Internet. Which was Snowden’s basic point.It turns out that the fake government program that records pictures is
                less far-fetched than you might imagine. As Snowden explained to Oliver in
                their interview, because companies like Google have servers physically
                located all over the world, even a simple message (perhaps including nudity)
                between a husband and wife within the same US city might first bounce off a
                foreign server. Since that data leaves the United States, even for a nanosecond,
                the NSA could, thanks to the Patriot Act, collect and archive that text or e-mail
                (including the indecent photo) because it technically entered the United States
                from a foreign source at the moment when it was captured.

                What if you created a strong password but didn’t write it down? Password
                resets are a godsend when you absolutely can’t access an infrequently used
                account. But they can also be low-hanging fruit for would-be attackers. Using
                the clues we leave in the form of social media profiles all over the Internet,
                hackers can gain access to our e-mail—and other services—simply by
                resetting our passwords.One attack that has been in the press involves obtaining the target’s last four
                digits of his or her credit card number, and then using that as proof of identity
                when calling in to a service provider to change the authorized e-mail address.
                That way, the attacker can reset the password on his or her own without the
                legitimate owner knowing.
